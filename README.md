## 📖 Introduction
This project analyzes the Airbnb dataset to uncover patterns and trends about room types, pricing, neighborhood groups, and more. By applying data cleaning techniques and analyzing the results, the project helps identify key features influencing price, availability, and review activity.

---

## 📦 Importing Libraries
First, we import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

---

## 📂 Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. This dataset contains information about Airbnb listings, including price, room type, neighborhood, and more.

```python
file_path = "Airbnb_Open_Data new.csv"  # Update with your file path
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 102,599 rows and 26 columns. Each row represents an individual listing, with features such as room type, neighborhood group, price, and availability.

```python
df.head()  # Preview the first few rows of the dataset
```

---

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning
The data is cleaned by addressing issues such as mixed data types, missing values, and transforming columns (e.g., price) for analysis.

```python
df['price'] = df['price'].replace('[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)
```

## 📊 Data Analysis

### 🛏️ Room Type Distribution
We analyze the distribution of room types in the dataset to see which types are most common.

### 💵 Price Analysis
We examine the average price by room type to identify trends in pricing.

### 📍 Neighborhood Group Analysis
We analyze the number of listings in each neighborhood group.

### 🔎 Correlation Analysis
We calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numeric variables.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into Airbnb listings, such as the relationship between room type, pricing, neighborhood, and availability. The data cleaning process ensures the dataset is ready for further analysis.

---

## 💡 Future Work
- Predictive modeling: Building machine learning models to predict price based on various features.
- Handling missing values: Imputing missing data for better accuracy in analysis.
- Clustering analysis: Grouping listings by similar features to identify market segments.
