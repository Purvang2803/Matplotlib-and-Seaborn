## 📖 Introduction

This project analyzes the Airbnb dataset to uncover patterns and trends about room types, pricing, neighborhood groups, and more. By applying data cleaning techniques and analyzing the results, the project helps identify key features influencing price, availability, and review activity.

---

## 📦 Importing Libraries

We begin by importing the necessary libraries to handle data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

---

## 📂 Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. This dataset contains information about Airbnb listings, including price, room type, neighborhood, and more.

```python
file_path = "Airbnb_Open_Data new.csv"  # Update with your file path
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 102,599 rows and 26 columns. Each row represents an individual listing, with features such as room type, neighborhood group, price, and availability.

```python
df.head()  # Preview the first few rows of the dataset
```

---

## ℹ️ Data Info

We use this step to explore the dataset's structure, including the number of rows and columns, as well as the data types of each column.

```python
df.info()  # Check the structure and data types of the dataset
```

---

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning

### 🧹 Eliminating Duplicates

We remove any duplicate rows to ensure the dataset is clean and does not have repeated entries.

```python
df = df.drop_duplicates()
```

### ❌ Checking for Null Values in Each Column

Next, we check for missing or null values in each column and decide how to handle them.

```python
df.isnull().sum()  # Check for missing values in each column
```

### 🗑️ Dropping Unnecessary Columns

We drop any columns that are not required for our analysis to simplify the dataset.

```python
df = df.drop(['column_name'], axis=1)  # Replace 'column_name' with the actual column name to drop
```

### 📊 Examining Continuous Variables

We examine the continuous variables to ensure they are properly formatted for analysis.

```python
df['price'] = df['price'].replace('[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)  # Example of cleaning a continuous variable
```

---

## 🔢 Print All Columns

We print all column names to ensure we know which features are available for analysis.

```python
print(df.columns)
```

---

## 🎨 Theme Setting

We set the aesthetic of our plots, such as color themes or style settings, to make the visualizations more appealing.

```python
plt.style.use('seaborn')  # Example of setting a theme for plots
```

---

## 📊 Data Visualization: Using Plots to Find Relationships Between Features

In this section, we visualize the relationships between different features of the dataset. These include plots to analyze room types, price distributions, neighborhood group distributions, and more.

```python
# Example plot for visualizing price distribution
plt.hist(df['price'], bins=50, color='blue', alpha=0.7)
plt.title("Price Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Price ($)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

---

## 📊 Data Analysis

### 🛏️ Room Type Distribution
We analyze the distribution of room types in the dataset to see which types are most common.

### 💵 Price Analysis
We examine the average price by room type to identify trends in pricing.

### 📍 Neighborhood Group Analysis
We analyze the number of listings in each neighborhood group.

### 🔎 Correlation Analysis
We calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numeric variables.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into Airbnb listings, such as the relationship between room type, pricing, neighborhood, and availability. The data cleaning process ensures the dataset is ready for further analysis and model building.

---

## 💡 Future Work

- **Predictive Modeling:** Create machine learning models to predict listing prices based on features like room type, neighborhood, etc.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Implement more advanced techniques to handle missing or null values.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Group listings based on similar features to identify market segments.
